__Gambetech__ is a mix of __NGAMBEKET__ which means *The Truth* in [Bamoun](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foumban, "") and the contraction of the word __Technology__ which is the current focus of our organization.

__Gambetech__  is a personnal brand that reflect point of view, reflection, opinions, orientations and most importantly actions to disrupt and contribute to africa development.


__Gambetech__ is part of a journey, it is the journey of a modern first generation immigrant worker: from a young graduated trying to make his parents proud, through a young worker looking for his own purpose, to a growth entrepreneur _trying to shape his environment in the way he want to feel comfortable leaving in_. 
 
__Gambetech__ isn't a regular software company. coding was not a vocation. coding helped us put a meal on our table and financially sustains our family in Africa but adaptability, creativity, empathy, care, integrity, humility and imagination are on our bone, so as we learned to code, we learned that _we can make computers do whatever we want, we can start a revolution, we can inform, we can disrupt, we can influence, we can growth, we can shape our own future._

__Gambetech__  is an innovation. The first company to ever adopt the innovative [__Wealth Sharing Model__](https://thanksandshare.com) from [__Thanks & Share__](https://thanksandshare.com) as governance mode.

__Gambetech__ is building the following products and services with love

* Thanks & Share
