G@mbeTech is a journey, it is my journey from a young kid trying to make his parents proud, to a young man searching his own purpose, to a growth man _starting to shape his environment in the way he want to feel comfortable leaving in_. 

G@mbeTech is my point of view, my reflection, my opinions, my orientations and most important my actions.

_G@mbeTech_ is a mix of __NGAMBEKET__ my birth name which means *The Truth* in my [native](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foumban) tongue language and the contraction of the word __Technology__ which is the current focus that drive my worklife.  
    __G@mbetech__ is basicly my attempt to create my ideal work/life balance.

G@mbetech is a letter to him.
