By the end of 2016, after working for almost 10 years as Software Engineer for various IT contractors in Paris Area, France. 
I started my journey as an Entrepreneur **i mean**  _I started to shape my environment in the way that is convenient for me_.

Since then, I co-founded :  
* [Computation Hub](https://computationhub.com), sold back my share to my friend and founder,
* [Thanks & Share](http://www.thanksandshare.eu), In Early and Prototyping Stage [by invitation only](https://app.thanksandshare.com),
* [Garama](https://garama.ch) (in market validation stage).

I started this website: 
* [Gambetech](https://gambetech.com) as my personnal and reflection brand.
